# AsciiArtii

AsciiArtii is a simple Java tool that converts ASCII art to a .png image. ASCII art can be loaded from a file and is saved to the user's
root working directory.

This was an assignment that I worked on during my first semester at Mount Royal. The iteration here is an improvement on what I worked on
during the early days.
